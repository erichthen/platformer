platforms should not be rendered at all if invisible, rn the invisble ones can still be jumped on, fix this
quick fix: make sure falling blocks dissapear as soon as they hit green plat

add circular and other types of movement for platforms
more types of obstacles
more colors, dynamic changes
randomize platform generation //maybe
make this game long as hell, more, more, more levels
add checkpoints for easier testing
